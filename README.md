    It mainly includes small HTML and CSS projects, as of now, built to understand layouts, styling, and responsive design.

## Technologies & Concepts Covered

    - HTML (structure, semantic elements)

    - CSS (styling, layouts, Flexbox, Grid, responsive design (media queries), hover effects, transitions, basic animations)

    Projects may be simple and iterative, and will improve over time as I learn more technologies.
